# QFCC Contest Image

This page covers the details of the image built for contestants.

## Overview

Th contest image is based on [Debian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian),
and uses the [Live Build](https://live-team.pages.debian.net/live-manual/html/live-manual/index.en.html)
tools to create a custom image.

## Using the Image

 - Username: `qfcc`
 - Password: `qfcc`

## Language Support

All submissions should be contained in a single file with the `solution` basename.
The extension that should be used as well as how the solution will be run is in the following table:

| Language | Compiler Version | Extension | Invocation |
|----------|------------------|-----------|------------|
| C        |                  | `.c`      | `gcc solution.c &> compile.log && ./a.out &> out.log` |
| C++      |                  | `.cc`     | `g++ solution.cc &> compile.log && ./a.out &> out.log` |
| Java     |                  | `.java`   | `javac solution.java &> compile.log && java solution &> out.log` |
| Python   |                  | `.py`     | `python3 solution.py &> out.log` |
| Ruby     |                  | `.rb`     | `ruby solution.rb &> out.log` |

If you want to use a language not listed here,
be sure to contact the contest hosts well before the contest.
Most text-based languages with CLI support should be admissible.

## Text Editors

The following text editors are present in the image:

 - [Emacs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs)
   - A very powerful text editor that can be run in a terminal or GUI window..
   - One of the two best text editors (debatable, but generally accepted to be one of the best).
 - [Mousepad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mousepad_(software))
   - A very simple graphical editor.
   - Similar to:
     - Gedit (Gnome)
     - Notepad (Windows)
     - TextEdit (Mac)
 - [Nano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_nano)
   - A bare bones terminal text editor.
 - [Vim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor))
   - A very powerful terminal text editor.
   - The best text editor (according to Eriq).
     - Along with Emacs, these editors had withstood the test of time and are generally considered the best.
   - Note that `gvim` is not available because of dependencies within the image.

### Running Text Editors

This table summarizes some ways you can run each text editor.

| Editor   | Has Desktop Icon | Open Window | Run in Terminal |
|----------|------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Emacs    |        ✅        | `emacs`     | `emacs -nw`     |
| Mousepad |        ✅        | `mousepad`  |                 |
| Nano     |                  |             | `nano`          |

## Building the Image

We use [Live Build](https://live-team.pages.debian.net/live-manual/html/live-manual/index.en.html) to build our image,
which requires a Debian install.
To make it easy for anyone to build,
we use [Docker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)) to create a Debian container which can then build our contest image.

To build the image builder image:
```sh
docker build -t qfcc-image-builder .
```

To build the actual image/ISO:
```sh
docker run --rm --privileged -v ./build:/out qfcc-image-builder
```

## Testing the Image

The most straightforward way to test the image would be to burn it to a USB and run it.
To test it without needing a USB or another machine, you can use [QEMU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QEMU):

```sh
qemu-system-x86_64 --enable-kvm -cpu host -boot d -m 8G -cdrom ./build/build.amd64.iso
```

## Packages

The packages the image uses live in the [package](./package) directory.
